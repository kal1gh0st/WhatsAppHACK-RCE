#### How to use
---

##### Before you begin
- You will need an code editor of your choice. If you don't have one, we suggest downloading one of those:
[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.4.2.html)
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

> Step 1
- Download the landing page with button above.

> Step 2
- Extract the files and open the folder that appears after extraction.

> Step 3
- To change main site context, open `index.html` and you can make any changes in there.

> Step 4
- To add content locker, go to your favourite CPA Network and follow their instructions. In every case, you will need to include one `<script>` in the `<head>` of the `index.html` page and then attach the content locker call to an button. To find a button where you should add the content locker call, in `index.html`, search for `locker` and inside of it you will see a function that wraps `alert('demo')` which outputs `demo` as a message on click of the button. Simply swap the `alert('demo')` with your content locker call (e.g. `call_locker()`)

> Step 5 (optional)
- To change CSS, open `css/app.min.css` and beautify the file. You can Google for "CSS Beautify" or you can use the one that we mentioned for any file type. Make sure to minify the file after you're done, for faster page load.

> Step 6 (optional)
- To change JS, open `js/app.min.js` and beautify the file. You can Google for "JS Beautify" or you can use the one that we mentioned for any file type. Make sure to minify the file after you're done, for faster page load.

> Step 7 (optional)
- If landing page contains "console" that shows output messages of an "generator", you can edit them in `index.html` by searching for `consoleMessages`.
